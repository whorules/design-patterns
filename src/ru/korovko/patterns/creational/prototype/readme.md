Implementation of prototype pattern without using Cloneable interface

**Prototype** - is a creational pattern that allows to copy object without going into details of their implementation

#### Advantages:
* Allows to copy objects without being tied to their specific classes
* Less repeatable code for objects initialization
* Makes objects creation faster

#### Disadvantages:
* It's difficult to copy composite objects that have references to other objects
